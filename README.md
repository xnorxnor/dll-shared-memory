# dll-shared-memory
Simple project to show possible problems when using shared memory structures between DLL and DLL host.

Note: this projects shows how *not* to do it. It is an abstract version of propietary code and is intended to serve as an example of how interprocess communication between a DLL and a host should better not be designed. The task derived from this is to do the same functionality with modern means.
